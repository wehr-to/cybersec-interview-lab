# ðŸ§  Cybersecurity Interview Lab

A structured, high-signal preparation lab for blue team, detection, and security engineering interviews. Inspired by the LeetCode mentality â€” this repo approaches security interviews the same way software engineers and developers do. 

## ðŸŽ¯ Why This Repo Exists

Top devs treat interviews like a game â€” they study patterns, practice reps, and dominate. It's time security professionals had the same mindset.

This repo is for:
- Analyzing Tier 1â€“3+ security interview questions
- Practicing detection logic, whiteboard drills, and decision-making
- Sharpening mindset, triage thinking, and adversary emulation

## ðŸ§ª Example Prompts

- `tier3-detection/` â†’ "How would you detect reflective DLL injection using Sysmon?"
- `oncall-scenarios/` â†’ "You get an alert for unusual S3 activity at 2am. Walk through your triage."
- `whiteboard-drills/` â†’ "Map an IR workflow across NIST CSF's Detect & Respond categories."
- `case-based/` â†’ Full mock: "Initial access via phishing, persistence via RunKey â€” show your playbook."
